### Midterm - Rev the engine through the press of a single button
Plan 1: Access the ecu
- Get a software/hardware that can send input through the obd2 port or a reader
issue: cheap ones only take in inputs, the ones that can control throttle costs upward of 500 dollars
pros: pretty cool, straight forward
Plan 2: plug computer into the ecu directly
- slice the scrap engine wires to make a custom wire that connects the ecu port to the pc
issue: wires were damaged, the port handled more than just throttle position and required trial and error
pros: 
plan 3:
