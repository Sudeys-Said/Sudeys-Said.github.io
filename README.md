### Midterm - Rev the engine through the press of a single button
- Plan 1: Access the ecu
  - Get a software/hardware that can send input through the obd2 port or a reader
    - Issue: cheap ones only take in inputs, the ones that can control throttle costs upward of 500 dollars, and dealers (liers) said it's not possible 
    - Pros: pretty cool, straight forward
- Plan 2: plug computer into the ecu directly
  - splice the scrap engine wires to make a custom wire that connects the ecu port to the pc
    - Issue: wires were damaged, the port handled more than just throttle position and required trial and error
    - Pros: direct communication, cheaper, more educational/interesting
- plan 3: motor with gears that move the potentiometer inside the accelarator
  - cut up the accelarator and remove the pedal, place a screw with a gear and connect it to the potentiometer, and send the input to the stepomotor to move the gear thus moving the the acclarator. The current is then allowed to continue to the throttle position sensor allowing it to rev.
    - Issues: simplistic, required trouble shooting, gears that cam with the stepomotor were useless and required vex gears,
    - Pros: simplistic, functional, modular and cost effective



### Final project - dual booting ubuntu and windows and setting up an open source obd2 diagnostic on the tv
Started of setting up and dual booting the computer.
  - issues faced: currupted windows, currupted usbs
  - solutions: wiped and re-installed ubuntu and windows
installing obd2
